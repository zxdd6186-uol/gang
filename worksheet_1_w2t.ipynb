    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you may encounter an error when trying to push your changes. This often happens when Team Member A pushes new changes to GitHub, and then Team Member B tries to push changes from an outdated local copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to Do When You Get an Error:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Receive the Error:**\n",
    "   - When Team Member B runs `git push`, an error message appears similar to:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     > \"error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/your_repo/week2m.git'\"\n",
    "     \n",
    "     This indicates that the remote repository contains changes that you don't have locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pull the Latest Changes:**\n",
    "   - In the terminal, run:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     git pull\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     This command fetches and merges the remote changes into your local branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resolve Merge Conflicts (if any):**\n",
    "   - If Git reports merge conflicts, it will list the files that are in conflict.\n",
    "   - Open each conflicting file in your editor. You will see conflict markers that look like this:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     <<<<<<< HEAD\n",
    "     Your changes here\n",
    "     =======\n",
    "     Changes from GitHub (Team Member A's changes) here\n",
    "     >>>>>>> [commit hash]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Detailed Merge Instructions:**\n",
    "     - **Examine the Conflict:** Look at the sections between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` (your changes) and the section between `=======` and `>>>>>>> [commit hash]` (the incoming changes).\n",
    "     - **Decide What to Keep:** Determine if you want to keep your version, the incoming version, or a combination of both.\n",
    "     - **Edit the File:** Remove the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`) after you have resolved the conflict. Ensure that the final file reflects the correct, merged content.\n",
    "     - **Save the File:** After editing, save your changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Stage and Commit the Merge Resolution:**\n",
    "   - Stage the resolved files with:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     git add <filename>\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Repeat for each file with conflicts.\n",
    "   - Commit the merge resolution:\n",

    "     ```bash\n",
    "     git commit -m \"Resolved merge conflicts\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Push Your Changes:**\n",

    "## Detailed Merge Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run `git pull` and receive merge conflicts, follow these detailed steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify the Conflict Files:**\n",
    "   - Git will list the files with conflicts. For example:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Auto-merging search_list.py\n",
    "     CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in search_list.py\n",
    "     Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Open the Conflicted File:**\n",
    "   - Open the file (e.g., `search_list.py`) in your editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Review the Conflict Markers:**\n",
    "   - The file will contain sections like:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     <<<<<<< HEAD\n",
    "     # Your changes\n",
    "     print(\"Team Member B's version\")\n",
    "     =======\n",
    "     # Team Member A's changes\n",
    "     print(\"Team Member A's version\")\n",
    "     >>>>>>> abcdef1234567890\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Everything between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` is your local version, while the code between `=======` and `>>>>>>>` is from the remote repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Resolve the Conflict:**\n",
    "   - Decide which version to keep, or combine the code logically. For example, you might decide to combine both prints:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # Combined version\n",
    "     print(\"Team Member B's version\")\n",
    "     print(\"Team Member A's version\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Remove all conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) so that only the final code remains.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Save the File:**\n",
    "   - After editing and ensuring that the file now has the correct merged content, save the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Stage and Commit the Resolved File:**\n",
    "   - Stage the resolved file:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     git add search_list.py\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Commit the resolution:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     git commit -m \"Resolved merge conflict in search_list.py\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Push the Merged Changes:**\n",
    "   - Finally, push the merged code to GitHub:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     git push\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
